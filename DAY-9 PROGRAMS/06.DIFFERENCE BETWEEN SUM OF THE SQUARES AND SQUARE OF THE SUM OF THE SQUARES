CODES:
n = 200
sum_of_squares = sum(i**2 for i in range(1, n + 1))
square_of_sum = sum_of_squares ** 2
difference = square_of_sum - sum_of_squares
print("Sum of the squares:", sum_of_squares)
print("Square of the sum:", square_of_sum)
print("Difference:", difference)


OUTPUT:
Sum of the squares: 2686700
Square of the sum: 7218356890000
Difference: 7218354203300
