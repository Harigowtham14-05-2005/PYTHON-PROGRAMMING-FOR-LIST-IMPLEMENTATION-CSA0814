CODES:
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
odd_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 != 0, lst)
even_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, lst)
squared_odds = [x ** 2 for x in odd_numbers]
print("Even numbers:", list(even_numbers))
print("Squared odd numbers:", squared_odds)


OUTPUT:
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Squared odd numbers: [1, 9, 25, 49, 81]
